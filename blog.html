        <p>Hey guys! Happy September! I loooovvveee Fall! its probably one of my favorite seasons along with winter and
            summer, actually I
            think I just love all the seasons. Anyways, that is why I loved making the Hello Fall Sticker pack, I love
            all the fall colors, pumpkin spice smells,
            all the leaves changing, it's great! Today, I'm going to do some more work on sticker packs and <a
                class="social-link" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/" target="_blank">Free Code Camp</a>
            to get in some more practice and learn more and more about html and css. I have also been working on a
            succulent sticker pack for quite a while and I am
            super excited to share it with you and see what you think! Make sure you follow me at the links on the Home Page to see some
            more updates about the Etsy Shop and my Art! Have a Wonderful first day of September and I will talk to you all next time!

        <p>Hey guys! Blog post number 2! I am going to be working some
            more on the website today! I think that I am going to add the
            section for my art and sticker designs, because that was another thing that
            I wanted for this website. In there I am going to add photos of my sticker designs
            (will be for sale on Etsy, Coming Soon!) which I am super excited about! I ordered a Cricut
            Explore Air 2 which is supposed to get here on Thursday. In case you don't know what a Cricut is,
            it is a die cut machine. And if you don't know what a die cut machine is, just look it up,
            anyways the Cricut will cut the stickers out that I have been drawing. So stay tuned for those really soon!
            I hope you guys have a great day and until next time, Bye! </p>

        <p>Hi! This is my first Blog Post!
            I've been working on my website quite a bit, and it has been
            really fun! Special thanks to my Dad for helping me a ton with this
            project! In case you didn't know, I've been putting together this website
            all by code! (CSS and HTML) I've been doing lessons on Free Code Camp to learn
            all about CSS, HTML, Web Design, and a lot more! So if you want to make a website just like
            me, I will leave a link for you to check it out below this post! Have a great
            day and until next time, Peace Out! </p>
